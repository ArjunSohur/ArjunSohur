Hi,

My name is Arjun Sohur - I'm an undergrad student at the University of Chicago ('26) studying computational and applied math along with business economics.

I'm like working with natural language and recomendation systems speficially with the goal to improve everyday life.

If you want to reach out to me, you can email me at: lowercase(concatenate(first_name, last_name)) at gmail dot com.
