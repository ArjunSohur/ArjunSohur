Hi,

My name is Arjun Sohur - I'm an undergrad student at the University of Chicago ('26) studying computational and applied math along with business economics.

I like building stuff.

If you want to reach out to me, you can email me at: lowercase(concatenate(first_name, last_name)) at gmail dot com.
